Deis Labs is a shoutout to Deis, the organization where many of us started our journey into Kubernetes and Open Source - creating and nuturing the Helm project and working to simplify the tooling around Container Native development and operations.

Over the past year and a half, we have been busy continuing that same mission; bolstered by new colleagues and resources within the Cloud Native Compute Team of Microsoft Azure. You may be familiar with some of our work:

* [Draft](https://github.com/azure/draft)
* [Brigade](https://github.com/azure/brigade)
* [Kashti](https://github.com/azure/kashti)
* VS Code Extensions
* [and more...](https://github.com/deislabs/)

We're excited for some upcoming releases - watch this space!
